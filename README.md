# Write-QR-name-on-QR-stuff
smallest size possible QR code to print on sticker paper and put on your possessions. elegant way to write your name on your things.

The smallest known size safely readable by the average camera/QR code reader is approximately 2 cm x 2 cm, so knowing this try to print as many per page as you can (less paper and ink)-- but make sure when printing the dimensions are maintained! if physically smaller than the aforementioned dimensions, the QR codes may not be readable! 

if you want to tweak the QR code there are other libraries, i personally suggest using [Segno](https://segno.readthedocs.io/en/latest/artistic-qrcodes.html), in particular the [qrcode-artistic](https://pypi.org/project/qrcode-artistic/) part of the library.
